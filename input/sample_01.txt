GraphRAG LangGraph sample document 1.

Contoso Labs is experimenting with graph-based retrieval-augmented generation
to answer questions over a small corpus of technical memos. The team uses
GraphRAG to build a knowledge graph of entities such as organizations, people,
and research topics, and then runs global and local search over the graph.

Key entities:
- Contoso Labs (organization)
- Fabrikam AI (organization)
- Graph-based RAG (research topic)
